   <b> Age</b>
   <br>
   <br>

In theory, age shouldn't be a large determinant of an IBW past the ages of 14-15 for girls and 16-17 for boys
, after which most people stop growing. It is actually expected that human males and females lose 1.5 and 2 inches in height respectively
 by age 70. It is important to remember that as people age, lean muscle mass decreases and it is easier to accumulate excess body fat.
  This is a natural process, though it is possible to lessen the effects of aging by adopting various habits such as monitoring diet,
 exercise, stress, and sleep.
</p>

<p>
   <b> Gender </b>
   <br><br>

Generally, females weigh less than males even though they naturally have a higher percentage of body fat.
 This is because the male body generally has higher muscle mass, and muscle is heavier than fat.
 Not only that, but women generally have lower bone density. Last but not least, males tend to be taller than females.

</p>
<p>

    Body Frame Size

Body frame size is another factor that can have a significant impact on the measurement of ideal weight.
 Body frame size is typically categorized as small, medium, or large boned.
 It is measured based on the circumference of a person's wrist in relation to their height, as shown below.
<br><Br>
<b>For women:</b>

<ul>
    <li>Height under 5'2"</li>
<li>Small boned = wrist size less than 5.5"</li>
<li>Medium boned = wrist size 5.5" to 5.75"</li>
<li>Large boned = wrist size over 5.75"</li>
<li>Height between 5'2" and 5' 5"</li>
<li>Small boned = wrist size less than 6"</li>
<li>Medium boned = wrist size 6" to 6.25"</li>
<li>Large boned = wrist size over 6.25"</li>
<li>Height over 5' 5"</li>
<li>Small boned = wrist size less than 6.25"</li>
<li>Medium boned = wrist size 6.25" to 6.5"</li>
<li>Large boned = wrist size over 6.5"</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<b>For men:</b>
<ul>
<li>Height over 5' 5"</li>
<li>Small boned = wrist size 5.5" to 6.5"</li>
<li>Medium boned = wrist size 6.5" to 7.5"</li>
<li>Large boned = wrist size over 7.5"</li>

</ul>
A person who is large boned will naturally weigh more than someone who is small boned, even at the same height,
 making body frame size a factor that can affect measurements such as IBW and BMI.
